Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   1
Number of warnings :   4

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:198 - NCD was not produced.  All logic was removed from the design. 
   This is usually due to having no input or output PAD connections in the
   design and no nets or symbols marked as 'SAVE'.  You can either add PADs or
   'SAVE' attributes to the design, or run 'map -u' to disable logic trimming in
   the mapper.  For more information on trimming issues search the Xilinx
   Answers database for "ERROR:Pack:198" and read the Master Answer Record for
   MAP Trimming Issues.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:830 - Cannot automatically set COMPENSATION attribute for PLL_ADV
   clkin/rx_pll_adv_inst because no input clock signal was found.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal d_p connected to top level port d_p has been
   removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal d_n connected to top level port d_n has been
   removed.
WARNING:MapLib:701 - Signal reset connected to top level port reset has been
   removed.
